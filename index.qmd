## Description

RNA-Seq is an emerging technology in next generation sequencing (NGS) procedures for measuring gene expressions. RNA-Seq can be used for gene differential expression analysis of samples exposed to different experimental conditions. 

In this study we use RNA-Seq for determining differences between gene expression for three experimental groups of pregnant females: diabetics diagnosed during 1st trimester, diabetics diagnosed during 2nd trimester and non-diabetics (control).

## Objectives

1. Test if there are statistical differences between the gene expressions of diabetic and non-diabetic pregnant females. 

2. Test if there are statistical differences between the gene expressions of diabetic pregnant females diagnosed during the first and the second trimester.

## Variables

| Name | Description | Type | Units (scale) |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Id | Individual indentification key | Nominal | |
| Group | Experimental group | Nominal | C (control), DG1 (diabetic 1st T), DG2 (diabetic 2nd T) |
| Gene | Gene expression | Nominal | Cluster-1 to Cluster-5446 |
| Count | RNA-Seq count | Discrete | Count | 

## Sample size

Number of individuals (pregnant females) in the study: 21

- Controls (C) : 7
- Diabetics 1st trimester (DG1): 7
- Diabetics 2nd trimester (DG2): 7
